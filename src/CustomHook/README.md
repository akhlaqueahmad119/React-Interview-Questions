<!-- What is a Custom Hook in React? -->

A Custom Hook in React is a JavaScript function that allows you to encapsulate and reuse logic across different components. Custom Hooks start with the prefix use, similar to the built-in Hooks like useState, useEffect, etc. They enable you to extract and share logic without changing the component hierarchy.

<!-- Why Use a Custom Hook? -->

Code Reusability: Custom Hooks help you avoid code duplication by allowing you to share logic across multiple components.

Separation of Concerns: By moving complex logic into a Custom Hook, your components become cleaner and easier to manage.

Abstraction: Custom Hooks allow you to abstract complex operations, making your components simpler and more focused on UI concerns.
