The useRef hook in React is used to create a mutable object that persists across renders. This object can store any value, and changes to it do not trigger re-renders. It's commonly used for accessing and interacting with DOM elements directly, as well as for storing values that don't need to trigger a component update when changed.

Key Characteristics:

Mutable Object: The object returned by useRef has a current property where you can store a value. This value can be updated without causing the component to re-render.
Persistent Value: The value stored in a useRef object persists across renders, which makes it useful for keeping track of values that should not be reset on each render.
Direct DOM Access: useRef is often used to access DOM elements directly, bypassing React's virtual DOM. This is useful for things like focusing input elements, measuring element dimensions, or integrating with third-party libraries that manipulate the DOM.



<!-- Uses of useRef -->

1. Accessing DOM Elements.
2. Storing Mutable Values.
3. Maintaining a Previous Value.
4. Storing Mutable Objects or Arrays.
5. Preventing Re-creation of Functions or Values.
6. Avoiding Re-renders for Expensive Calculations.
